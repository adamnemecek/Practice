# Makefile Example
## Purpose
The purpose of this example makefile is to enable students following textbook programming exercises to quickly adopt custom libraries provided by the text. It is up to the user to specify Include and Library directories for the given custom library, and it is assumed that the user does not install these custom libraries to the default locations, but rather as sibling directories to their textbook exercises.
