<h1>Skeleton Web Application using Node JS</h1>

<p>This is a sample web application. It demonstrates how I would structure my web application in order to closely resemble that of an MVC framework. User authentication and structure of routing should not be replicated. Also, I removed a lot of content for posting this application on GitHub so it will not work as intended.</p>
